    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pasta is a type of food typically made from an unleavened dough of 
        wheat flour mixed with water or eggs, and formed into sheets or other shapes, 
        then cooked by boiling or baking. Rice flour, or legumes such as beans or lentils, 
        are sometimes used in place of wheat flour to yield a different taste and texture, 
        or as a gluten-free alternative.

    <p>Pasta, a staple of Italian cuisine, is a delightful dish known for its versatility and rich variety. 
        It is typically made from an unleavened dough of wheat flour mixed with water or eggs, 
        formed into numerous shapes, and then cooked by boiling or baking². 
        Pasta can be divided into two broad categories: dried (pasta secca) and fresh (pasta fresca), 
        each offering a distinct texture and taste experience².

        Imagine a plate of al dente spaghetti, each strand perfectly coated 
        in a velvety tomato sauce, or a hearty lasagna layered with tender pasta 
        sheets and gooey melted cheese. The sensory experience of pasta is not just in the taste but also in its texture—from the silky smoothness of perfectly cooked noodles to the satisfying bite of pasta cooked al dente¹.
        Whether it's the delicate flavor of thin angel hair pasta or the robust, hearty taste of rigatoni, pasta dishes can range from creamy and comforting to zesty and vibrant. With over 310 specific forms known by over 1,300 documented names, pasta's diversity is as rich as its history².
